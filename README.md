# NECTR Ranger Training - text-based adventure game

This repository contains an educational [Inform 7](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/) project intended to teach the role to new NECTR Rangers. The game is currently in development and is incomplete, but you're welcome to clone the repository and test it out! PRs for new modules are also welcome :)
